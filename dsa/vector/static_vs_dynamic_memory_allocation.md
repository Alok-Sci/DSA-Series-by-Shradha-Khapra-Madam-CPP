# Static VS Dynamic Memory Allocation

## 1. Static Memory Allocation
- Memory is allocated during ___compile-time___.
- Arrays are the example of `Static memory allocation` as we need to declare the size of arrays beforehand.
- It is fixed (can't be resized).
- Static memory allocation happens within `Stack Memory`.

## 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Memory is allocated during ___runtime___.
- Vectors are the example of `Dynamic memory allocation` as we don't need to declare the size of vectors beforehand, the size is adjusted during runtime.
- It can be resized.
- Dynamic memory allocation happens within `Heap Memory`.
